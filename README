t's a solution for Ubuntu (the idea also works for Windows or Mac) I just tried today and it works like a charm.

Material

    a cross-over Ethernet cable (the name is fancy but it's just a normal Ethernet cable)
    a laptop (ubuntu)
    a Raspberry Pi (I have the Pi2)

Prerequisites on your ubuntu

    Install network-manager

    $sudo apt-get install network-manager

    Install nmap

    $sudo apt-get install nmap

Edit Wired connection on your laptop (Ubuntu)

    Change IpV4 settings to "Share to other computers"
    Save the setting
    Reboot your laptop

Share WiFi connection of your laptop via Ethernet crossover cable

    Hook up your RPi with your laptop using the Ethernet cable

    Look up the broadcast address of the Ethernet connection (Laptop),

$/sbin/ifconfig eth1 | grep "Bcast" | awk -F: '{print $3}' | awk '{print $1}' 10.42.0.255

    Use this address to find out the IP address of your RPi, it's 10.42.0.96 in my case because 10.42.0.1 is my laptop

    $nmap -n -sP 10.42.0.255/24

      Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2016-02-20 23:07 CET
      Nmap scan report for 10.42.0.1
      Host is up (0.00031s latency).
      Nmap scan report for 10.42.0.96
      Host is up (0.0023s latency).
      Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.71 seconds

    Login to your RPi from your laptop (-Y with X-forwarding)

    $ssh -Y pi@10.42.0.96

    Lo and behold! Now your RPi is connected to your laptop and RPi can share the WiFi connection.

    pi@raspberrypi ~ $

Share display & keyboard of your laptop with RPi

    Install vncserver on Raspberry Pi

    $ sudo apt-get update

    $ sudo apt-get install tightvncserver

    Install vncviewer on your laptop by downloading RealVNC (it supports multiple platforms) http://www.realvnc.com/download/vnc/

    To be able to copy & paste from VNC server <--> VNC viewer, you need to install autocutsel on your RPi.

$sudo apt-get install autocutsel

If this site doesn't work, try to download the .deb directly from a mirror site, e.g. mirror.hmc.edu/debian/pool/main/a/autocutsel/autocutsel_0.10.0-1_armhf.deb
and install it

$sudo dpkg -i autocutsel_0.10.0-1_armhf.deb

    Start vncserver on your RPi (You have to restart vncserver after installing autocutsel, you can issue $vncserver -kill :1)

    $vncserver :1

    Add autocutsel -fork to /home/pi/.vnc/xstartup

     #!/bin/sh
     xrdb $HOME/.Xresources xsetroot -solid grey 
     autocutsel -fork
     #x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
     #x-window-manager &
     # Fix to make GNOME work 
     export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1 
     /etc/X11/Xsession

    Start vncviewer on your laptop

    $vncviewer

    A vncviewer window will pop up and type in the IP address of your RPi (given by your laptop) followed by port 1, which is your VNC server. for example: 10.42.0.96:1 in my case.

    Connect it to the vncserver hosted on your RPi by typing in a password (set up a password yourself)

    12.Now you can see the desktop of RPi on your laptop, and I opened my browser to show the shared WiFi connection is working as well.
